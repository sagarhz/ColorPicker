ðŸŒˆ ColorPicker: A Dynamic Art Installation Using Python

In this code, Iâ€™m showcasing a project that blends art and technology to create a live, interactive display of dominant colors from your environment. Using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy, this program captures video frames from your webcam, analyzes the colors, and transforms them into a beautiful, wavy visual field.

The project uses techniques like K-means clustering for color detection, sinusoidal blending for smooth transitions, and Gaussian blur to enhance the artistic effect. Plus, it displays the RGB values of the dominant colors in real-time, giving it a stylish and technical touch.

ðŸ’¡ Concept: Imagine this as a public art installation with LED lights. It reacts to its surroundingsâ€”daylight, city lights, or even peopleâ€™s clothingâ€”bringing life to urban spaces with dynamic colors.

âœ¨ Features of the Code:
Detects dominant colors from live video using K-means clustering.
Generates smooth, evolving color transitions with sinusoidal patterns.
Displays RGB info for a real-time breakdown of the detected colors.
Designed to inspire public or personal projects that combine data and visual art.
